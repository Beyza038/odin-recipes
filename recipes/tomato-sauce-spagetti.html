  <h1>Tomato Sauce Spagetti</h1>
  <p>In the fast-paced world of culinary creations, sometimes, it's the simplest recipes that bring us the most joy.
  With just a handful of carefully chosen ingredients and a dash of creativity, you'll be savoring the magic of this dish in no time.</p>

  <h2>ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>8 oz (225g) of spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of thyme</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup of finely grated or diced cheese (e.g., Grana Padano)</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>

  <li>In a large pot, bring water to a rolling boil. Don't forget to
  generously salt the water; this is your chance to infuse the pasta
  with flavor from the very beginning.</li>
  <li>Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Cook it according to the package
  instructions until it reaches to the perfect al dente texture.</li>
  <li>While your pasta is cooking, In a small saucepan, heat the olive
    oil over low to medium heat.</li>
  <li>Add a generous spoonful of tomato paste to the pan. Scoop out one cup of
    starchy pasta cooking water and slowly add it to the saucepan. Stir it into
    the oil until it's well incorporated and fragrant.</li>
  <li>Season your sauce with the thyme, pepper, and a teaspoon of sugar.</li>
  <li>Now, it's time for the star of the show, the cheese! Gently fold in your
  finely grated or diced cheese. Stir until it melts into the sauce, creating
  a lusciously creamy and cheesy concoction.</li> 
  <li>By now, your pasta should be just about ready. Drain it, but make sure to
  save a little bit of that starchy pasta cooking water it might come in handy later.</li>
  <li>Add the drained spaghetti directly into the saucepan with the cheesy sauce. 
    Mix everything together and let it simmer over low heat until all the cheese is 
    gloriously melted, and the pasta is coated in a creamy, cheesy embrace.</li>
</ol>
